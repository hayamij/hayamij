## 👋 Hello there, I'm Phuong Tuan 🍞
Welcome to my digital shelf — where code, logic, and a touch of creative flair meet.  
I'm a full-stack developer in practice, but deep down, I’m a **backend artisan**. I live and breathe **algorithms**, **data structures**, and the elegance of **well-designed databases**.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- 💾 Languages: `C#`, `C++`, `PHP`, `T-SQL`, `Java`, `JS`
- 🧱 Backend: `PHP`, `C#`, `.NET`, `MySQL`
- 🌐 Frontend (if I must): `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- 🛠️ Tools: Git, VSCode, Azure Data Studio, Photoshop (sometimes)

---

### 🧊 Personality Stack
> `Difficult` + `Diligent` + `Detail-oriented`  
> If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right — or not at all.
